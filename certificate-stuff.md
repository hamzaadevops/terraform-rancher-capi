## Rancher OSS vs Rancher Prime

### Rancher OSS (Open-Source)

* Free and fully open-source: No vendor lock-in, community-supported, suitable for developers, startups, and SMBs. ([DevOps School][1], [documentation.suse.com][2])
* Core features include:

  * Multi-cluster management across various providers (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)
  * RBAC, monitoring/logging (Prometheus, Grafana)
  * Application deployment via Helm, and cluster management via UI ([DevOps School][1], [documentation.suse.com][2])

### Rancher Prime (Enterprise)

* Built on the same open-source code, with added enterprise value. Introduced as the commercial enterprise offering since Rancher v2.7. ([ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com][3], [Rancher Labs][4])
* Enhanced capabilities:

  * 24/7 SLA-backed support, enterprise-grade support and lifecycle management ([DevOps School][1], [Rancher Labs][4])
  * Advanced security & compliance: FIPS 140-2, DISA STIG, FedRAMP (targeting highly regulated industries) ([DevOps School][1])
  * Enhanced features: Longhorn Prime storage, automated cluster hardening, advanced disaster recovery, CI/CD workflows, AIOps observability, central RBAC/policies ([DevOps School][1], [Rancher Labs][4])
  * Managed by SUSE: Rancher Prime includes hosted/managed options where SUSE handles installation, upgrades, backups, monitoring, fully managing the platform for you ([SUSE][5])

In summary:

| Security/Compliance     | Basic              | Enterprise-grade (FIPS, FedRAMP, etc.)            |
| Enterprise Capabilities | Core features only | Extended features, hardening, DR, premium tooling |
| Managed Service         | DIY                | Optional managed service by SUSE                  |

## Can Rancher Prime auto-rotate downstream RKE2 cluster certificates?

You mentioned it's not available in the free version and causes outages—let’s clarify what Rancher (and Prime) support regarding certificate rotation.

### Rancher UI–based Certificate Rotation

* Rancher (both OSS and Prime) supports manual certificate rotation via the UI for launched Kubernetes clusters, including RKE2. You go to Cluster Management → \[Cluster] → ⋮ → Rotate Certificates, and choose to rotate all or specific service certs. ([documentation.suse.com][6], [ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com][7])
* This is not “automatic” rotation—it requires manual user action.

### RKE2 Built-in Certificate Rotation (outside Rancher)

* Independently of Rancher, RKE2 supports certificate rotation via CLI:

  * `rke2 certificate rotate` for service certificates.
  * `rke2 certificate rotate-ca` for CA certificates, with certain safeguards and options (including non-disruptive vs. force rotation) ([docs.rke2.io][8])
  * RKE2 can also auto-rotate certificates during restart if they are within 90 days of expiring or already expired. ([docs.rke2.io][9])

### What’s Not Available

* Rancher (OSS or Prime) does not provide fully automatic, unattended downstream RKE2 certificate rotation. The UI only offers manual execution.
* If the automatic rotation behavior of RKE2 itself (based on expiry conditions and restarts) is not sufficient or working, you might face certificate expiry issues leading to cluster downtime.

Even in Rancher Prime, there is no documented feature for orchestrating automatic rotations of downstream RKE2 certificates beyond what Rancher UI allows. ([documentation.suse.com][6], [ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com][7], [docs.rke2.io][8])

---

## Recommendations to Avoid Outages

1. Monitor certificate expiry proactively:

   * Use tools like `x509-certificate-exporter` with Prometheus to track expiry dates. ([Support Tools][10])

2. Set up periodic manual or automated rotations:

   * Via Rancher UI: schedule reminders to rotate certificates before expiry.
   * Or use CLI automation (scripts or Terraform) to run `rke2 certificate rotate` or `rotate-ca` ahead of expiration.

3. Leverage Rancher Prime for added operational confidence, but understand certificate rotation remains a manual (or separately automated) responsibility—even with Prime.

---

### TL;DR

* Rancher OSS is free, open-source; Rancher Prime adds enterprise-grade support, security, compliance, and managed options.
* Auto-rotation of downstream RKE2 certs is not built into Rancher Prime—manual rotation via the UI, or RKE2 CLI-based automation, is needed to prevent expiry-related outages.
